To have our main loop run, you need to put the main.service file in the right directory.
if you're in this directory on your pi, you can run this:

sudo cp main.service /lib/systemct/system/main.service

Then you need to refresh it

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

then enable. You can disable by changing "enable" to "disable"

sudo systemctl enable main.service
