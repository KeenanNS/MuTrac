To get any of this working you must do a couple things. 

ls /dev/tty*

unplug the module, and run the command again, see which dev changed. THis is your usb port.
for me it is /dev/ttyACM0.

you want to end the systemd process for this. 

sudo systemctl stop gpsmd

you need to edit the configuration file of the service to look for the gps data on a more broad ip.

edit /lib/systemd/system/gpsd.socket field "listenstream" to be 0.0.0.2947

then kill any process

sudo killall gpsd

then 

sudo gpsd /dev/ttyACM0 -F /var/run/gpsd.socket  !remember this device may be different for you

try running the command gpsmon

if this shows you nice things, you are good to go. You can write some programs in C or python to interface with the module. You can get raw data from the GPS just by sude cat /dev/ttyACM0 as well


All together 

sudo apt-get install libgps-dev  you'll need this to compile the program

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps
sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl disable gpsd.socket
nano /lib/systemd/system/gpsd.socket
sudo kilall gpsd
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyACM0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
